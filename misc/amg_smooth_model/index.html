            <p> Are you the proud owner of a 3D printer who has often thought to themselves, <i> I wish that my prints were algebraically smooth</i>?  I imagine the answer is <i>probably not</i>, but on the off chance that you're a multigrid nerd with a 3D printer lying around, I have just the remedy.</p>

                    A 3D-printed multigrid error, based on Figure 8.2 from <i>A Multigrid Tutorial</i>.

                This is a model of Figure 8.2 from <i>A Multigrid Tutorial</i> <a href="#brigs2000">(Briggs et al., 2000)</a> showing error that is algebraically smooth, yet not geometrically smooth on an example PDE problem that is solved using 8 iterations of Gauss-Seidel relaxation.  The top-left, top-right, and bottom-right quadrants (wrt to the above figure) have strong anisotropy in specific directions, leading to the interesting error patterns that are shown.

                You can grab the <code>.obj</code> file as well as the reference Jupyer notebook used to generate the model here.  The resulting mesh can be different based on the random seed used to initialize the error; though, in practice these differences are very slight.
